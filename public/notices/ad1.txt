Looking for People to Chat With ☕,

Hey there! My name’s Tom, and I’m from Toronto. I’m just looking for some cool people to chat with — about music, travel, games, life, or even the weather (and trust me, in Toronto, there’s always something to say about the weather 😅).
Not looking for anything specific, just enjoy meeting new people and swapping stories. If you feel like having a casual conversation, don’t hesitate to reach out!
               
                                                 thx,
                                                 TomTheMoose#4827
